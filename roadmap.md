Here’s a concise Node.js roadmap to create a working demo for the system you described. I’ve structured it step by step so you can show users a functional demo quickly:

Step 1: Set Up the Project

Initialize Node.js project:

mkdir user-project-dashboard
cd user-project-dashboard
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken multer dotenv ejs


Structure folders:

/models
/routes
/controllers
/public
/views
/uploads

Step 2: Create User Authentication

Use JWT for login sessions.

Create User model (with username, email, password).

Routes:

/register → create a new user.

/login → authenticate and return token.

Use bcryptjs for password hashing.

Step 3: Admin Authentication

Use a separate Admin model or flag in user schema (isAdmin: true).

Admin can log in and access all users’ uploads.

Step 4: File Upload System

Use Multer to handle uploads.

Save files in /uploads/{userId}/.

Ensure file names are unique and original quality is maintained.

Routes:

/upload/project → user uploads project files.

/upload/media → user uploads photos/videos.

Step 5: User-Specific Visibility

Store metadata in MongoDB: { userId, filePath, type, timestamp }.

When fetching uploads:

Admin: can see all uploads.

User: can only see files where userId = their ID.

Step 6: Admin-to-User Communication

Create a “private message” collection: { senderId, receiverId, message, file }.

Admin sends messages to a user.

User can view only messages where receiverId = userId.

Step 7: Profile & Upload Dashboard

User Dashboard:

View personal uploads.

Upload new projects, videos, photos.

See admin replies.

Admin Dashboard:

View all user uploads.

Send messages to specific users.

Access user profile info.

Step 8: Demo Frontend

Use EJS templates for simplicity.

Pages:

login.ejs

register.ejs

dashboard.ejs (user/admin)

Upload forms integrated with Multer.

Step 9: Security & Access Control

Protect routes using JWT middleware.

Only allow admins to access other users’ data.

Validate file types and sizes for media.

Step 10: Show Working Demo

Seed a sample admin and user account.

Demonstrate:

User login and upload.

Admin login and reply to user.

User sees admin messages and uploaded files.

Uploading photos/videos keeps high quality.

Optional: Show media organized per user folder.
